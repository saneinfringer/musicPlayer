# Music Player

Showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built a versatile music player. It boasts a user-friendly interface with intuitive playback controls (play/pause, volume, seek bar) and a responsive design that adapts seamlessly across devices.

Leveraging HTML5, I efficiently integrated audio elements and structured a clean layout. With CSS, I crafted a visually appealing design that adjusts for various screen sizes. JavaScript shines through the interactive playback controls, offering a smooth music listening experience. (Playlist functionality coming soon!)
